# Palindrome Checker

## Description
A web application to check if a given text is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward (ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing).

## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- Case-insensitive: The checker ignores the case of the characters in the input.
